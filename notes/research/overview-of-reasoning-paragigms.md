**Overview of Reasoning Paradigms in LLM Agents**

Modern large language model (LLM) agents use **structured prompting schemes** to improve reasoning. Well-known approaches include _Chain-of-Thought_ (CoT) prompting, where the model generates an explicit reasoning trace, and its variants such as **Self-Consistency** (generating multiple CoT answers and voting)[cameronrwolfe.substack.com](https://cameronrwolfe.substack.com/p/prompt-ensembles-make-llms-more-reliable#:~:text=self,techniques%20that%20work%20even%20better). Beyond linear chains, newer schemes like _Tree of Thoughts_ (ToT) and _Graph of Thoughts_ (GoT) arrange intermediate "thoughts" in richer structures. For example, Tree-of-Thoughts lets the model explore multiple branches of reasoning (with backtracking and lookahead)[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601#:~:text=Game%20of%2024%2C%20Creative%20Writing%2C,all%20prompts%3A%20this%20https%20URL), whereas Graph-of-Thoughts represents reasoning steps as a general graph, merging and looping thoughts flexibly[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2308.09687#:~:text=We%20introduce%20Graph%20of%20Thoughts%C2%A0,state%20of%20the%20art%20on)[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2308.09687#:~:text=GoT%C2%A0is%20particularly%20well,over%20ToT). Agentic frameworks often interleave reasoning with actions, as in the **ReAct** paradigm, which alternates chain-of-thought reasoning with task-specific actions (e.g. tool or API calls) to fetch evidence or act in an environment[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629#:~:text=trustworthiness%20over%20methods%20without%20reasoning,code%3A%20%2018%20this%20https). Other strategies include _Tiny Recursive Models_ (TRMs), which are small neural modules that recursively refine partial solutions (e.g. solving Sudoku by repeated reasoning)[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2511.08653v3#:~:text=Building%20upon%20this%20principle%2C%20the,However), and _GEPA_ (Genetic-Pareto Prompt Evolution), which uses LLM-based reflection in a genetic search to iteratively improve prompts[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19457#:~:text=from%20sparse%2C%20scalar%20rewards,and%20by%20up%20to%2020). All of these paradigms aim to help LLM agents perform complex reasoning tasks more reliably[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2401.14295v3#:~:text=elaborate%20tasks%20with%20a%20single,performance%20of%20the%20LLM%20reasoning)[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2511.10788v1#:~:text=benchmark%20for%20evaluating%20intelligence,the%20LLM%20context%2C%20connecting%20these).

- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT):** Prompt the LLM to "think step-by-step" in a single chain. This often greatly boosts reasoning accuracy[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2308.09687#:~:text=Chain,facilitates%20using%20different%20paths%20of).
- **Self-Consistency (CoT-SC):** Generate many CoT answers and vote on the final answer. Averaging over diverse CoT outputs has been shown to improve accuracy[cameronrwolfe.substack.com](https://cameronrwolfe.substack.com/p/prompt-ensembles-make-llms-more-reliable#:~:text=self,techniques%20that%20work%20even%20better).
- **Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT):** Explore a search tree of thought sequences, allowing the model to backtrack and choose among multiple reasoning paths[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601#:~:text=Game%20of%2024%2C%20Creative%20Writing%2C,all%20prompts%3A%20this%20https%20URL). For instance, GPT-4 with ToT solved 74% of "Game of 24" problems versus only 4% with CoT[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601#:~:text=Game%20of%2024%2C%20Creative%20Writing%2C,all%20prompts%3A%20this%20https%20URL).
- **Graph-of-Thoughts (GoT):** Form an arbitrary graph of thoughts (nodes as reasoning steps, edges as dependencies)[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2308.09687#:~:text=We%20introduce%20Graph%20of%20Thoughts%C2%A0,state%20of%20the%20art%20on). GoT can merge branches and create feedback loops; on benchmark tasks it outperformed ToT and CoT by large margins (e.g. 62-70% higher solution quality on a sorting task) while even reducing inference cost[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2308.09687#:~:text=We%20introduce%20Graph%20of%20Thoughts%C2%A0,state%20of%20the%20art%20on)[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2308.09687#:~:text=GoT%C2%A0is%20particularly%20well,over%20ToT).
- **ReAct (Reason+Action):** Alternate reasoning with actions (such as queries or tool calls). ReAct can mitigate LLM hallucinations by retrieving external facts mid-reasoning. On tasks like question-answering or interactive games, ReAct agents significantly outperformed pure CoT or RL baselines[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629#:~:text=trustworthiness%20over%20methods%20without%20reasoning,code%3A%20%2018%20this%20https).
- **Tiny Recursive Models (TRM):** Compact neural reasoning modules (≈7M parameters) that iteratively refine solutions through deep, nested recursion[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2511.08653v3#:~:text=Building%20upon%20this%20principle%2C%20the,However). Despite tiny size, TRMs match or exceed much larger LLMs on structured reasoning tasks (e.g. Sudoku, maze puzzles) by "trading inference steps for model size"[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2511.08653v3#:~:text=Building%20upon%20this%20principle%2C%20the,However).
- **GEPA (Genetic-Pareto Prompt Evolution):** An automated prompt optimizer. GEPA samples model execution traces, has the LLM reflect in natural language on failures, and evolves prompts via a genetic algorithm. This reflective approach outperformed RL-based prompt tuning (Group PPO) by ∼10% on average while using 30-35× fewer trials[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19457#:~:text=from%20sparse%2C%20scalar%20rewards,and%20by%20up%20to%2020).

Each of these algorithms can be used as modular reasoning "skills" in an agentic framework. In practice, they can be combined sequentially, run in parallel (ensembles), or integrated in hybrid pipelines. For example, ReAct inherently **composes** CoT reasoning with acting. Similarly, GoT generalizes CoT and ToT by combining multiple thought traces into a network[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2308.09687#:~:text=We%20introduce%20Graph%20of%20Thoughts%C2%A0,state%20of%20the%20art%20on). The emerging **taxonomy** of LLM reasoning treats these as different "topologies" (chain, tree, graph) that guide the inference process[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2401.14295v3#:~:text=elaborate%20tasks%20with%20a%20single,performance%20of%20the%20LLM%20reasoning).

**Adaptive Reasoning Strategies**

A central challenge in LLM reasoning is **adaptivity**: adjusting the reasoning effort to the task's difficulty. Rather than using a one-size-fits-all chain length or strategy, adaptive methods allocate compute where needed. Wu _et al._ define _adaptive reasoning_ as "the capability to allocate reasoning effort based on input characteristics such as difficulty and uncertainty"[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2511.10788v1#:~:text=benchmark%20for%20evaluating%20intelligence,the%20LLM%20context%2C%20connecting%20these). In other words, an adaptive LLM should answer easy questions quickly and spend more steps on hard ones, mimicking human meta-cognition[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2511.10788v1#:~:text=benchmark%20for%20evaluating%20intelligence,the%20LLM%20context%2C%20connecting%20these).

Researchers have explored both training-time and inference-time techniques for adaptivity. **Training-based** approaches incorporate reasoning control into the learning objective. For example, _budget-aware reinforcement learning_ trains the model to optimize a tradeoff between answer accuracy and inference cost. One method (IBPO) treats inference steps as a policy: it learns to assign more token budget to hard questions and less to easy ones[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2511.10788v1#:~:text=%28Yu2025IBPO%29%20formulates%20an%20inference,reasoning). Others add rewards for using concise reasoning or penalize over-long chains. Variants like LASER or SABER dynamically adjust the reward for chain length during training, yielding models that internalize when to stop reasoning[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2511.10788v1#:~:text=,Methods)[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2511.10788v1#:~:text=Instead%20of%20applying%20external%20halting,This%20section%20reviews%20five). Supervised fine-tuning and distillation have also been used: models are trained on paired long/short rationales so they learn to compress reasoning without losing correctness[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2511.10788v1#:~:text=A%20complementary%20line%20of%20work,tuning). These methods give the model an internal sense of _when_ to reason at length and _when_ to truncate, based on data or learned budgets[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2511.10788v1#:~:text=Instead%20of%20applying%20external%20halting,This%20section%20reviews%20five)[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2511.10788v1#:~:text=%28Yu2025IBPO%29%20formulates%20an%20inference,reasoning).

Inference-time (training-free) adaptations adjust strategy on-the-fly. A common technique is **early stopping** or **halting**: during generation, the agent measures its confidence or token entropy and stops the chain once it is "sure enough." For instance, an _entropy-halting_ rule terminates decoding when uncertainty falls below a threshold[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2511.10788v1#:~:text=Instead%20of%20applying%20external%20halting,This%20section%20reviews%20five). Specialized schemes like ES-CoT and DEER use heuristics or statistical tests to decide when to abandon a reasoning branch or stop expanding a tree[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2511.10788v1#:~:text=Instead%20of%20applying%20external%20halting,This%20section%20reviews%20five). Other methods adjust temperature or sampling dynamically based on partial confidence. In summary, adaptive strategies try to balance accuracy and cost; they may use learned controllers (RL-based policies) or simple rules (prompt-based signals, confidence measures) to modulate reasoning length[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2511.10788v1#:~:text=formalize%20adaptive%20reasoning%20as%20a,We)[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2511.10788v1#:~:text=Instead%20of%20applying%20external%20halting,This%20section%20reviews%20five).

Notably, self-supervised cues like entropy or past experience can help the model gauge difficulty. For example, if a partial solution appears inconsistent or uncertain, the system can allocate additional steps or spawn new branches. These mechanisms - whether baked into training or applied at inference time - implement the meta-reasoning idea of "reflect, evaluate, and continue or stop"[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2511.10788v1#:~:text=formalize%20adaptive%20reasoning%20as%20a,We)[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2511.10788v1#:~:text=Instead%20of%20applying%20external%20halting,This%20section%20reviews%20five). In practice, combining learned policies (from training with budgeted rewards) with dynamic inference control (confidence-based halting) yields the most flexible agents.

**Self-Improving and Reflective Algorithms**

Beyond adaptive inference, a powerful class of methods lets LLMs _improve themselves_ over time. **Self-improvement** here means using the LLM's own outputs or interactions to enhance its performance without external labels. Several recent lines of work illustrate this concept:

- **Self-training on unlabeled data:** LLMs can generate their own training examples via chain-of-thought, then fine-tune on them. One approach is to run CoT + self-consistency on unlabeled questions, collect the "high-confidence" solutions as pseudo-labels, and then continue training on this generated dataset. Liu _et al._ (2022) showed this "self-consistency fine-tuning" dramatically raises accuracy: e.g. a 540B LLM went from 74.4%→82.1% on GSM8K math problems without any ground truth[lesswrong.com](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qwqowdhnMreKQvxLv/paper-large-language-models-can-self-improve-linkpost#:~:text=Abstract%3A%20,parameter%20LLM). In effect, the model teaches itself by trusting and learning from its own best outputs.
- **Reflective feedback loops:** Some algorithms have the LLM reflect on its own reasoning traces to identify and correct mistakes. For example, in prompting schemes for scientific writing, a model may compare its answer with a reference and generate a reflection on what's missing[nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44387-025-00045-3?error=cookies_not_supported&code=b9a51b75-e0e7-4b9f-8150-584a056f257d#:~:text=Self,and%20offering%20improvements%20where%20necessary). Adding an explicit _self-refinement_ step - where the model reviews and edits its initial answer - can improve quality. In one peer-review response task, simply asking the LLM to critique and refine its first draft (a "self-refine" step) boosted scores over plain CoT outputs[nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44387-025-00045-3?error=cookies_not_supported&code=b9a51b75-e0e7-4b9f-8150-584a056f257d#:~:text=Self,and%20offering%20improvements%20where%20necessary). This resembles the idea of _iterative self-correction_ or _chain-of-thought zooming_, where the model revisits its output to make it more coherent or complete.
- **Evolutionary prompt optimization (GEPA):** Algorithms like GEPA use the model itself to search for better prompts or program encodings. GEPA repeatedly samples execution trajectories, has the LLM reflect in natural language on failures, then mutates prompts via an evolutionary (Genetic-Pareto) search[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19457#:~:text=from%20sparse%2C%20scalar%20rewards,and%20by%20up%20to%2020). This _meta-level_ reasoning - using language to critique and tweak prompts - lets the model improve performance over trials. Results show GEPA outperforms traditional RL-based tuning: it achieved ~10% higher scores than PPO-style fine-tuning on benchmark tasks, while using orders of magnitude fewer samples[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19457#:~:text=from%20sparse%2C%20scalar%20rewards,and%20by%20up%20to%2020).
- **Reward learning for reasoning (Reasoning Advantage):** Even without external labels, we can define internal reward signals that encourage better reasoning. Foster _et al._ (2024) introduce a _Reasoning Advantage (RA)_ reward that measures the value of a generated reasoning chain and optimizes it via offline RL. Their experiments suggest that carefully crafted reward functions can allow "compute-only" self-improvement: the LLM refines its reasoning skills using its pretraining data alone[neurips.cc](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2024/106591#:~:text=investigate%20a%20fundamental%20question%20in,should%20investigate%20more%20powerful%20optimisation). This opens the door to continual self-training where the model boosts its CoT ability purely by optimizing such rewards.

In summary, self-improvement in LLMs combines auto-generated data, reflective feedback, and internal reward signals to iteratively enhance reasoning. These techniques blur the line between inference and learning: the model uses language-based introspection (prompt reflection, self-consistency voting, or learned reward shaping) to get better answers over time[lesswrong.com](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qwqowdhnMreKQvxLv/paper-large-language-models-can-self-improve-linkpost#:~:text=Abstract%3A%20,parameter%20LLM)[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19457#:~:text=from%20sparse%2C%20scalar%20rewards,and%20by%20up%20to%2020).

**Composing Multiple Algorithms**

A key insight is that **combinations of reasoning algorithms often outperform any single approach**. Agentic frameworks can flexibly compose strategies in series, in parallel, or in hybrid loops. For example:

- **Sequential Pipelines:** One can chain methods: e.g. use CoT to break a problem into subproblems, solve each (perhaps with a separate model or strategy like TRM), and then merge results. JidoAi's modular design allows feeding the output of one algorithm into another. For instance, an agent might first apply a ToT search to generate candidate plans, then use an LLM (via CoT) to verify or refine the best plan. Another example is ReAct itself: it runs CoT reasoning, then takes an action (e.g. querying a database), then feeds the result back into its reasoning loop[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629#:~:text=trustworthiness%20over%20methods%20without%20reasoning,code%3A%20%2018%20this%20https).
- **Parallel Ensembles:** Multiple reasoning instances can be run simultaneously and aggregated. The simplest case is _self-consistency_ (an ensemble of CoT chains)[cameronrwolfe.substack.com](https://cameronrwolfe.substack.com/p/prompt-ensembles-make-llms-more-reliable#:~:text=self,techniques%20that%20work%20even%20better). More generally, one can use a **prompt ensemble**: query the LLM with different carefully-designed prompts (or even different reasoning paradigms) and then vote or combine the outputs[cameronrwolfe.substack.com](https://cameronrwolfe.substack.com/p/prompt-ensembles-make-llms-more-reliable#:~:text=Such%20an%20approach%2C%20called%20a,be%20constructed%20automatically%20without%20significant). Recent work shows prompt ensembles (and their learning-based variants) further boost accuracy and robustness. For example, an ensemble of diverse CoT prompts can capture different "angles" on a problem and yield a more reliable final answer[cameronrwolfe.substack.com](https://cameronrwolfe.substack.com/p/prompt-ensembles-make-llms-more-reliable#:~:text=Such%20an%20approach%2C%20called%20a,be%20constructed%20automatically%20without%20significant)[cameronrwolfe.substack.com](https://cameronrwolfe.substack.com/p/prompt-ensembles-make-llms-more-reliable#:~:text=self,techniques%20that%20work%20even%20better). In fact, a survey of LLM collaboration techniques classifies _Ensemble_ strategies as a distinct class: merging outputs of multiple LLM runs (possibly on different prompts or models) to leverage their complementary strengths[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06089#:~:text=primary%20approaches%3A%20Merging%2C%20Ensemble%2C%20and,way%20for%20advanced%20NLP%20applications).
- **Hybrid/Cooperative Schemes:** Some approaches explicitly combine distinct algorithms. Graph-of-Thoughts, for instance, generalizes trees by merging thought nodes; it can be seen as a **cooperative** structure where different reasoning threads influence each other[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2308.09687#:~:text=We%20introduce%20Graph%20of%20Thoughts%C2%A0,state%20of%20the%20art%20on). Tiny Recursive Models themselves are hybrid: they use a small neural reasoner multiple times and accumulate reasoning steps (a form of _iterative self-composition_). More broadly, we can treat each algorithm as a specialized "agent" in a multi-agent scheme. For example, one agent might handle arithmetic (via TRM), another handles text reasoning (via CoT), and their results are fused. The "Merge, Ensemble, and Cooperate" taxonomy highlights this: one can _merge_ models (e.g. fine-tuning one on another's outputs), _ensemble_ their answers, or let them _cooperate_ sequentially on subtasks[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06089#:~:text=primary%20approaches%3A%20Merging%2C%20Ensemble%2C%20and,way%20for%20advanced%20NLP%20applications).

In practice, JidoAi's architecture leverages such composability. Each strategy (ReAct, CoT, ToT, GoT, TRM, GEPA, etc.) can be plugged in as a component. Agents can run them one after another (sequential), spawn multiple runs (parallel), or interleave their operations (hybrid). For example, one could use Tree-of-Thoughts to propose multiple reasoning chains, then invoke GEPA to refine the best prompt for any particularly tricky branch. Or the agent could run CoT and Graph-of-Thoughts in parallel and choose the more confident result. By exploring such combinations, systems can exploit the strengths of each method.

**Empirical Benefits of Combining Strategies**

Empirical evidence shows these hybrid and ensemble approaches yield superior results. Notable examples include:

- **Prompt Ensembles and Self-Consistency:** Simply generating multiple chains with CoT (self-consistency) or using multiple prompts reliably improves accuracy. Studies show that voting over diverse outputs significantly reduces error[cameronrwolfe.substack.com](https://cameronrwolfe.substack.com/p/prompt-ensembles-make-llms-more-reliable#:~:text=self,techniques%20that%20work%20even%20better). Prompt ensembles (different prompts) generalize this idea and likewise boost performance[cameronrwolfe.substack.com](https://cameronrwolfe.substack.com/p/prompt-ensembles-make-llms-more-reliable#:~:text=Such%20an%20approach%2C%20called%20a,be%20constructed%20automatically%20without%20significant). These methods cost more compute but often achieve near-state-of-the-art results on hard tasks.
- **Graph-of-Thoughts (GoT) Gains:** GoT explicitly merges reasoning branches. In benchmarks, GoT achieved ~70% better quality than CoT and ~62% better than ToT on a complex sorting task[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2308.09687#:~:text=GoT%C2%A0is%20particularly%20well,over%20ToT). Crucially, it did so with 31% less cost than ToT, showing that a more structured approach can be more efficient as well. This indicates that combining and condensing multiple thought paths can yield both accuracy and efficiency gains[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2308.09687#:~:text=GoT%C2%A0is%20particularly%20well,over%20ToT).
- **Tree-of-Thoughts Success:** ToT itself is a hybrid in spirit (exploring alternatives). Its dramatic success on problems like Game of 24 (74% solved vs. 4% by CoT[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601#:~:text=Game%20of%2024%2C%20Creative%20Writing%2C,all%20prompts%3A%20this%20https%20URL)) highlights that allowing the model to branch, look ahead, and backtrack can unlock problems otherwise impossible for linear prompting.
- **TRM vs. LLMs:** Composing recursion and supervision in TRMs shows that small networks can _effectively simulate_ very large LLM reasoning. This is a kind of hybrid design: using iterative computation to emulate depth. Empirically, TRMs (~7M params) matched or exceeded 10000× larger LLMs on puzzles[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2511.08653v3#:~:text=Building%20upon%20this%20principle%2C%20the,However), demonstrating that combining computation (recursion) with a specialized architecture can be as powerful as sheer scale.
- **GEPA vs. RL:** As a compositional strategy, GEPA uses LLM reflections as part of a genetic search loop. It significantly improved performance over pure RL tuning: e.g., GEPA outperformed PPO-based fine-tuning by ~10% with far fewer environment interactions[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19457#:~:text=from%20sparse%2C%20scalar%20rewards,and%20by%20up%20to%2020). This highlights that letting the model "talk to itself" in natural language to critique and evolve solutions can beat treating it as a black-box policy learner.

Overall, the trends are clear: **no single strategy solves everything**. Instead, the best performance often comes from **mixing methods**. For example, one might use ToT to find candidate plans, use CoT or TRM to verify parts of those plans, and apply GEPA to fine-tune any ambiguous prompt components. The JidoAi framework is designed for this: it can run multiple reasoning agents and merge their results. In doing so, it aligns with recent research advice that collaborative or ensemble approaches leverage "diverse capabilities" of LLMs for the strongest results[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06089#:~:text=primary%20approaches%3A%20Merging%2C%20Ensemble%2C%20and,way%20for%20advanced%20NLP%20applications)[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2401.14295v3#:~:text=elaborate%20tasks%20with%20a%20single,performance%20of%20the%20LLM%20reasoning).

**When and How to Combine Strategies**

Practically, the choice of combination depends on the task:

- **Tasks with clear subgoals or multi-step logic** (math puzzles, code problems) often benefit from chaining algorithms. Use CoT or ToT to decompose and explore solution paths, possibly verified by a TRM or checked via retrieval (ReAct). For instance, complex mathematical reasoning might start with CoT, then use self-consistency and stopping rules to ensure correctness, with GEPA refining any unclear prompt wording.
- **Search/planning tasks** (game playing, route planning) are well-suited to Tree- or Graph-of-Thought expansions. Running multiple branches in parallel (ToT) or merging insights (GoT) can drastically improve success. On these, combining ToT with confidence-based early stopping (adapting how deep to search) is often key.
- **Knowledge-intensive or tool-augmented tasks** (QA with external data) benefit from ReAct and graph-based retrieval. Here one might chain LLM reasoning with web/API calls, then use reflection (GEPA or self-consistency) to polish answers. If external graph data is available, a Graph-CoT approach (embedding the reasoning steps in the graph structure) can further anchor responses with real facts[medium.com](https://medium.com/@sulbha.jindal/graph-chain-of-thought-augmenting-large-language-models-by-reasoning-on-graphs-paper-review-ed760dc1e6bd#:~:text=Experiments%20show%20that%20GRAPH,for%20reasoning%20over%20connected%20knowledge1).
- **Time-sensitive scenarios** (applications needing speed) might prioritize lightweight reasoning: use shorter CoT chains with early halting heuristics, perhaps combined with a fast TRM draft. If accuracy is critical, one might afford a prompt ensemble or longer ToT search.

In all cases, some general guidelines emerge:

- Use **ensembles/self-consistency** (parallel runs) when you need higher accuracy or confidence[cameronrwolfe.substack.com](https://cameronrwolfe.substack.com/p/prompt-ensembles-make-llms-more-reliable#:~:text=self,techniques%20that%20work%20even%20better)[cameronrwolfe.substack.com](https://cameronrwolfe.substack.com/p/prompt-ensembles-make-llms-more-reliable#:~:text=Such%20an%20approach%2C%20called%20a,be%20constructed%20automatically%20without%20significant).
- Use **hybrid algorithms** (ReAct, GoT, TRM) when tasks demand multiple modalities (reasoning + action, merging of ideas, iterative refinement).
- Use **GEPA or RL-based tuning** when off-line optimization of prompts or strategies is possible (improving the agent over repeated trials).
- Use **adaptive stopping and controllers** (entropy-based halting, budget RL) to avoid wasteful overthinking on easy inputs[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2511.10788v1#:~:text=Instead%20of%20applying%20external%20halting,This%20section%20reviews%20five)[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2511.10788v1#:~:text=%28Yu2025IBPO%29%20formulates%20an%20inference,reasoning).

By thoughtfully combining algorithms in series or parallel, one can navigate the tradeoffs between cost and performance. The literature consistently finds that **composed systems** outperform any single component: e.g. Graph-of-Thoughts (a composite network approach) beat simpler schemas by large margins[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2308.09687#:~:text=GoT%C2%A0is%20particularly%20well,over%20ToT), and prompt-ensemble systems consistently improve reliability[cameronrwolfe.substack.com](https://cameronrwolfe.substack.com/p/prompt-ensembles-make-llms-more-reliable#:~:text=self,techniques%20that%20work%20even%20better)[cameronrwolfe.substack.com](https://cameronrwolfe.substack.com/p/prompt-ensembles-make-llms-more-reliable#:~:text=Such%20an%20approach%2C%20called%20a,be%20constructed%20automatically%20without%20significant). The JidoAi framework's ability to orchestrate multiple reasoning modules aligns with these findings. It enables building pipelines (sequential composition), spawning parallel reasoning workers, and evolving prompts - all ways to harness the diversity of recent reasoning algorithms for maximal performance[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2308.09687#:~:text=We%20introduce%20Graph%20of%20Thoughts%C2%A0,state%20of%20the%20art%20on)[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06089#:~:text=primary%20approaches%3A%20Merging%2C%20Ensemble%2C%20and,way%20for%20advanced%20NLP%20applications).
