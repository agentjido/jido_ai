## Implementation Details

### Work Completed

#### 1. Added ResponseAggregator Doctests

Added doctests to two key public functions in `lib/jido_ai/req_llm_bridge/response_aggregator.ex`:

**`format_for_user/2`** - 2 examples:
- Example 1: Formatting with integrated tool results
  - Shows tool result integration with `:integrated` style
  - Demonstrates how tool output is appended to content
- Example 2: Formatting without tool results
  - Simple content-only response
  - Default formatting behavior

**`extract_metrics/1`** - 2 examples:
- Example 1: Successful tool execution metrics
  - Shows token counts (prompt, completion, total)
  - Demonstrates tool success counting and rate calculation
  - 100% success rate with 2 tools executed
- Example 2: Failed tool execution metrics
  - Shows error handling in metrics
  - Demonstrates failed tool counting
  - 0% success rate with 1 failed tool

#### 2. Updated Test Configuration

Modified `test/jido_ai/req_llm_bridge/response_aggregator_test.exs` to include:
```elixir
doctest Jido.AI.ReqLlmBridge.ResponseAggregator
```

This enables ExUnit to discover and run the doctests embedded in the ResponseAggregator module documentation.

#### 3. Verification Results

Test execution confirmed successful implementation:
```
Finished in 0.5 seconds (0.4s async, 0.1s sync)
44 doctests, 540 tests, 0 failures, 540 excluded
```

**Doctest count progression:**
- Before: 40 doctests
- After: 44 doctests
- Added: 4 new doctests (2 functions × 2 examples each)

## Complete Doctest Coverage

### Required Modules (from Section 0 checklist)

| Module | Doctest Lines | Status | Functions Covered |
|--------|--------------|--------|------------------|
| ReqLlmBridge (main) | 13 | ✅ Complete | convert_messages, convert_response, map_tool_choice_parameters, build_req_llm_options |
| ErrorHandler | 8 | ✅ Complete | format_error, categorize_error_type, sanitize_error_for_logging |
| ToolBuilder | 8 | ✅ Complete | create_tool_descriptor, validate_action_compatibility |
| ResponseAggregator | 4 examples | ✅ Complete | format_for_user (2), extract_metrics (2) |
| ToolExecutor | 11 | ✅ Complete | create_callback |
| StreamingAdapter | 4 | ✅ Complete | continue_stream? |

### Bonus Modules (additional coverage)

| Module | Doctest Lines | Functions Covered |
|--------|--------------|------------------|
| ParameterConverter | 14 | Parameter transformation utilities |
| ProviderMapping | 9 | Provider name mapping and normalization |
| SchemaValidator | 16 | Schema validation and compliance |

### Intentionally Skipped

- **Authentication**: Requires session/env setup (GenServer state)
- **ConversationManager**: Complex ETS-based state management

These modules are covered by dedicated integration and unit tests instead of doctests, following the guideline to avoid doctests for stateful/GenServer operations.

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Doctest Best Practices Applied

1. **Self-Contained Examples**
   - All examples include necessary aliases
   - Data defined inline without external dependencies
   - No reliance on application state

2. **Realistic Data**
   - Used realistic response structures matching actual LLM responses
   - Token counts and metrics reflect real-world values
   - Tool result formats match actual integration patterns

3. **Multiple Scenarios**
   - Success cases (tool results present)
   - Simple cases (no tool results)
   - Error cases (failed tools in metrics)
   - Edge cases (0% and 100% success rates)

4. **Clear Assertions**
   - Direct value comparisons for simple metrics
   - String matching for formatted output
   - Explicit expected values (no placeholders)

### Example Quality

Each doctest demonstrates:
- ✅ Common use case (not edge case)
- ✅ Straightforward input and output
- ✅ Real-world scenario
- ✅ Expected behavior clearly shown
- ✅ No complex setup required

**After:**
- All examples are verified on every test run
- Breaking changes immediately caught by failing doctests
- Documentation stays synchronized with code
- Developers can trust all examples work as shown

**After:**
- Doctests provide fast verification (0.5 seconds)
- Immediate feedback if module doesn't load
- Quick validation of basic use cases
- Complement comprehensive test suites

### 3. Developer Experience ✅

**Before:**
- New developers had to read code to understand usage
- Examples might be scattered across test files
- Unclear which examples represent typical usage

**After:**
- Examples right in the documentation
- Clear demonstration of common use cases
- Self-contained, copy-pasteable examples

## Code Examples

### format_for_user/2 Doctest

```elixir
iex> alias Jido.AI.ReqLlmBridge.ResponseAggregator
iex> response = %{
...>   content: "The weather is",
...>   tool_calls: [],
...>   tool_results: [%{content: "sunny, 22°C"}],
...>   usage: %{total_tokens: 50},
...>   conversation_id: "conv_123",
...>   finished: true,
...>   metadata: %{processing_time_ms: 100}
...> }
iex> ResponseAggregator.format_for_user(response, %{tool_result_style: :integrated})
"The weather is\\n\\nBased on the tool result: sunny, 22°C"
```

**Demonstrates:**
- Response structure with tool results
- Integration of tool output into narrative
- `:integrated` formatting style option
- Realistic weather query scenario

### extract_metrics/1 Doctest

```elixir
iex> alias Jido.AI.ReqLlmBridge.ResponseAggregator
iex> response = %{
...>   content: "Result",
...>   tool_calls: [],
...>   tool_results: [%{content: "success"}, %{content: "ok", error: false}],
...>   usage: %{prompt_tokens: 10, completion_tokens: 20, total_tokens: 30},
...>   conversation_id: "conv_789",
...>   finished: true,
...>   metadata: %{processing_time_ms: 150}
...> }
iex> metrics = ResponseAggregator.extract_metrics(response)
iex> metrics.total_tokens
30
iex> metrics.tools_executed
2
iex> metrics.tools_successful
2
iex> metrics.tool_success_rate
100.0
```

**Demonstrates:**
- Metrics extraction from response
- Token counting (prompt, completion, total)

   - Test count increases immediately when doctests are added

2. **Example Complexity**
   - Keep examples simple and focused on one thing
   - Use realistic but minimal data structures
   - Avoid complex setup that obscures the point

3. **Response Structures**
   - Doctests validate actual function signatures
   - Help catch breaking changes in return values
   - Document expected data shapes clearly

### Best Practices Confirmed

1. **Documentation First**
   - Writing doctests improves documentation quality
   - Forces thinking about common use cases
   - Creates user-facing API examples

2. **Executable Specification**
   - Doctests serve as living specification
   - Examples never drift from implementation
   - Refactoring updates docs automatically

3. **Balance with Unit Tests**
   - Doctests for happy path and simple cases
   - Unit tests for edge cases and error conditions
