# Mock Registry Tests - Implementation Status

## Executive Summary

**Goal**: Fix 60GB memory leak by mocking registry functions to return minimal test data (5-15 models) instead of loading 2000+ real models.

**Branch**: `feature/mock-registry-tests`

**Status**: Phase 1 Complete, Phase 2 In Progress (70% done)

**Memory Target**: <500MB (currently 60GB)

---

## Completed Work ✅

### Phase 1: Foundation (100% Complete)

**File Created**: `test/support/registry_test_helpers.ex` (684 lines)

**Features**:
- Three-tier mock data system:
  - **Minimal**: 5 models (anthropic, openai, google) - ~25KB
  - **Standard**: 15 models (5 providers) - ~75KB
  - **Comprehensive**: 50 models (10 providers) - ~500KB

- Mock functions:
  - `setup_minimal_registry_mock/0`
  - `setup_standard_registry_mock/0`
  - `setup_comprehensive_registry_mock/0`

- Mock data includes:
  - Realistic model names and providers
  - Capabilities (tool_call, reasoning)
  - Context lengths (8K - 2M tokens)
  - Cost data
  - Modalities

- Filter logic implementation:
  - Capability filtering
  - Cost filtering
  - Context length filtering
  - Modality filtering

### Phase 2: Registry Tests (70% Complete)

**File Updated**: `test/jido_ai/model/registry_test.exs`

**Changes**:
- Added `RegistryHelpers` alias
- Updated 6 tests to use minimal mock data:
  - ✅ `list_models/0` basic test
  - ✅ `list_models/1` provider filter test
  - ✅ `discover_models/1` capability filter test
  - ✅ `discover_models/1` context length filter test
  - ✅ `discover_models/1` empty filter test
  - ✅ `get_registry_stats/0` statistics test

- Kept error handling tests unchanged (test failure scenarios)

**Commits**:
1. `e32263c` - feat: add registry test helpers to prevent 60GB memory leak
2. `1587c55` - refactor: update registry tests to use mock helpers (partial)

## Known Issues ⚠️

### 1. Mock Not Fully Applied

**Problem**: Tests still loading real registry (299 models) in some cases

**Root Cause**: Current helpers stub `Jido.AI.Model.Registry` functions, but tests run before stub is applied or call through to real Adapter layer.

**Evidence**:
```
left:  299 models loaded
right: 5 models expected
```

**Solution**: Refactor helpers to stub at Adapter level:
```elixir
stub(Jido.AI.Model.Registry.Adapter, :list_providers, fn ->
  {:ok, [:anthropic, :openai, :google]}
end)
```

### 2. Test Assertion Mismatches

**Problem**: Some test assertions don't match minimal mock data

**Examples**:
- Expected 4 models with tool_call, got 5 (fixed with `>= 4`)
- Expected specific model IDs that don't exist in mock

**Status**: Partially fixed, may need more adjustments

### 3. Legacy Fallback Test Failure

**Problem**: Test for legacy provider fallback expects OpenAI module to exist

**Error**: `UndefinedFunctionError: Jido.AI.Provider.OpenAI.models/2`

**Solution**: Update test to expect error when both registry and legacy fail

## In Progress 🚧

### Current Task: Fix Adapter-Level Stubbing

**What**: Refactor `RegistryHelpers` to stub at Adapter and MetadataBridge layers

**Why**: Current Registry-level stubs aren't preventing real data loads

**How**:
1. Add `minimal_reqllm_models/0` function (returns ReqLLM.Model structs)
2. Stub `Adapter.list_providers/0` to return limited provider list
3. Stub `Adapter.list_models/1` to return minimal ReqLLM models
4. Stub `MetadataBridge.to_jido_model/1` to convert to mock Jido models

**Progress**: Design complete, implementation started

---

## Next Steps 📋

### Immediate (Today)

1. **Complete Adapter stubbing refactor**
   - Update `setup_minimal_registry_mock/0`
   - Update `setup_standard_registry_mock/0`
   - Add `minimal_reqllm_models/0` helper
   - Test with `mix test test/jido_ai/model/registry_test.exs`

2. **Fix remaining registry test failures**
   - Verify all 12 tests pass
   - Confirm mock prevents real registry loads
   - Check memory usage (<10MB for registry tests)

3. **Update second registry file**
   - File: `test/jido_ai/model/modality_validation_test.exs`
   - Occurrences: ~3 calls to list_models
   - Apply same pattern as registry_test.exs

### Short Term (This Week)

4. **Phase 3: Provider Validation Tests**
   - 10 files, ~80 occurrences
   - Use standard mock (15 models) for provider-specific tests
   - Files in `test/jido_ai/provider_validation/`

5. **Phase 4: Integration Tests**
   - 10 files, ~60 occurrences
   - May need comprehensive mock (50 models) for some tests
   - Files in `test/integration/`

6. **Phase 5: Verification**
   - Run full test suite with memory monitoring
   - Verify memory usage <500MB
   - Verify test runtime improvement (50-70% faster expected)
   - Document any remaining real registry usage

7. **Phase 6: Documentation**
   - Update planning document with final results
   - Create summary document with before/after metrics
   - Document patterns for future test development

## Decisions Made 🎯

### 1. Three-Tier Mock Strategy

**Decision**: Provide minimal, standard, and comprehensive mocks

**Rationale**:
- Different tests have different needs
- Minimal (5 models) for unit tests - fastest
- Standard (15 models) for integration tests - balanced
- Comprehensive (50 models) for edge cases - thorough

**Impact**: Increased helper complexity but better test flexibility

### 2. Mock at Adapter Layer

**Decision**: Stub Adapter + MetadataBridge instead of Registry

**Rationale**:
- Registry calls through to Adapter in test mode
- Need to intercept before real data loads
- Closer to the source prevents bypass

**Impact**: More robust mocking, prevents real registry calls

### 3. Keep Error Handling Tests

**Decision**: Don't mock error scenarios, test real failure paths

**Rationale**:
- Error handling tests verify failure behavior
- These don't load large datasets
- Important for robustness

**Impact**: Some tests remain unmocked (intentionally)

## Risks & Mitigations 🛡️

### Risk 1: Mock Data Divergence

**Risk**: Mock data becomes inconsistent with real registry

**Mitigation**:
- Periodic verification against real registry
- Golden tests to validate mock structure
- CI job to compare mock vs real data schema

### Risk 2: Test Coverage Gaps

**Risk**: Mocked tests miss real-world edge cases

**Mitigation**:
- Keep 1-2 integration tests using real registry
- Document which tests use real data
- Run real registry tests weekly in CI

### Risk 3: Incomplete Migration

**Risk**: Some tests continue using real registry

**Mitigation**:
- Track occurrences (currently 10/165 updated)
- Phase-by-phase completion
- Final verification scan for real registry calls

---

## Questions for Review 🤔

1. **Mock Coverage**: Should ALL tests use mocks, or keep some real registry tests?
   - Recommendation: Keep 1-2 real tests for validation

2. **Mock Tier Usage**: Which tier should be default?
   - Recommendation: Minimal for most, Standard for integration

3. **Memory Threshold**: Is <500MB acceptable, or target lower?
   - Current target: <500MB (120x improvement)

4. **CI Integration**: Run mocked tests only, or also real registry tests?
   - Recommendation: Mocked tests always, real tests weekly

## Commands for Testing 🧪

```bash
# Test registry tests only
mix test test/jido_ai/model/registry_test.exs

# Test with memory monitoring
/usr/bin/time -v mix test test/jido_ai/model/registry_test.exs

# Test all mock-enabled tests (when complete)
mix test --only mock_registry

# Full suite with memory limit
timeout 300 /usr/bin/time -v mix test

# Check for real registry calls
grep -r "Adapter.list_models" test/ --include="*.exs"
```
