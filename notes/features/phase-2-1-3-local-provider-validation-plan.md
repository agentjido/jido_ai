# Phase 2.1.3: Local and Self-Hosted Model Validation - Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive implementation plan for Task 2.1.3 "Local and Self-Hosted Model Validation" from Phase 2. The task focuses on **validating** existing local and self-hosted provider support through Phase 1's `:reqllm_backed` interface, with special attention to the unique characteristics of local deployment scenarios.

## Context and Background

### Current State Analysis

Based on codebase research, the current local provider support includes:

**Ollama Support (Confirmed)**:
- Already accessible through `:reqllm_backed` interface
- Listed in `no_key_providers` (no API key required)
- Default configuration: `http://localhost:11434`
- Supports placeholder API key: `"ollama"`
- Already integrated with Instructor.ex for structured outputs

**LM Studio Support (Status)**:
- Not explicitly mentioned in current ReqLLM provider list
- ReqLLM roadmap shows "Ollama, LocalAI" as planned for 1.x
- LM Studio might be accessible via OpenAI-compatible endpoint patterns
- Requires investigation for current accessibility through `:reqllm_backed`

**Local Provider Characteristics**:
- No authentication required (placeholder keys accepted)
- Local network endpoints (localhost, custom ports)
- Service availability dependent on local installation
- Different error patterns than cloud providers
- Health check requirements for validation

### What This Task Accomplishes

This task ensures that local and self-hosted providers work correctly through the existing ReqLLM integration, establishes health check patterns for local services, validates model discovery for local deployments, and documents optimal usage patterns for privacy-conscious deployments.

- Mock model responses when models not available

#### 3. Network Configuration Variability
**Challenge**: Local providers may run on different ports/configurations
**Solution**:
- Test common default configurations
- Provide configuration override mechanisms
- Document configuration requirements clearly
- Test both localhost and network configurations

### Mock Strategy for Local Providers

#### External Service Mocking
- Mock HTTP calls to local provider endpoints when services unavailable
- Create realistic response fixtures for different local provider scenarios
- Simulate common error conditions (connection refused, timeout, etc.)
- Mock health check endpoints with various status responses

#### Test Environment Management
- Use environment detection to enable/disable integration tests
- Provide clear setup instructions for local testing
- Create Docker compose configurations for consistent test environments
