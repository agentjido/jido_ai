## Key Features Delivered

### 1. Tool-Enabled Text Generation
```elixir
{:ok, response} = ToolIntegrationManager.generate_with_tools(
  "What's the weather in Paris?",
  [WeatherAction],
  %{model: "gpt-4", temperature: 0.7}
)
```

### 2. Multi-Turn Conversations
```elixir
{:ok, conv_id} = ToolIntegrationManager.start_conversation([WeatherAction])
{:ok, response} = ToolIntegrationManager.continue_conversation(
  conv_id,
  "What's the weather in Paris and London?"
)
```

### 3. Concurrent Tool Execution
- Support for multiple tool calls in a single request
- Configurable concurrency limits (max 4 concurrent tools)
- Timeout handling with graceful degradation
- Individual tool failure isolation

### 4. Streaming Support
- Real-time streaming responses with tool calls
- Incremental tool execution as calls are detected
- Buffered partial tool calls until complete

### 5. Conversation Management
- ETS-based in-memory storage for fast access
- Automatic conversation cleanup (30-minute intervals)
- Conversation-specific tool and option persistence
- Thread-safe concurrent access

### 6. Response Formatting
- Intelligent tool result integration into natural language
- Configurable formatting styles (integrated, appended, separate)
- Comprehensive metrics extraction
- Error sanitization for user safety

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Integration Flow
1. **Request Initiation**: `ToolIntegrationManager` receives user request
2. **Tool Conversion**: Jido Actions converted to ReqLLM tool descriptors
3. **LLM Request**: ReqLLM called with tools and user message
4. **Response Processing**: `ToolResponseHandler` processes LLM response
5. **Tool Execution**: Individual tools executed concurrently via `ToolExecutor`
6. **Result Aggregation**: `ResponseAggregator` combines results into final response
7. **Conversation Update**: `ConversationManager` stores interaction history

### 2. Error Handling Strategy
- **Graceful Degradation**: Individual tool failures don't stop entire request
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevents cascade failures across tool executions
- **Timeout Management**: Configurable timeouts with automatic cleanup
- **Error Sanitization**: Security-conscious error message filtering
- **Retry Logic**: Built-in retry mechanisms for transient failures

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- **Concurrent Execution**: Multiple tools execute simultaneously
- **ETS Storage**: Fast in-memory conversation state management
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient resource utilization
- **Streaming Processing**: Real-time response handling
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup prevents memory leaks

## Testing Results

### 1. Functionality Tests
