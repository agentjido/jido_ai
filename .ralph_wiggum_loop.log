1) changed files
- `test/jido_ai/stable_smoke_test.exs:7`  
Added ST-OPS-001 smoke coverage for:
- required story-card section contract (`Goal`, `Scope`, `Acceptance Criteria`, `Stable Test Gate`, `Docs Gate`, `Example Gate`, `Dependencies`)
- traceability matrix ID parity and duplicate prevention
- `ralph_wiggum_loop.sh` usage/example path assertions
- ST-OPS-001 repo-path reference assertions in `specs/stories/01_ops_examples_core.md`

2) tests/commands executed
- `mix format test/jido_ai/stable_smoke_test.exs` ✅
- `mix format --check-formatted` ✅
- `mix compile --warnings-as-errors` ✅
- `mix test.fast` ❌  
  Failed in this sandbox with `failed to open a TCP socket in Mix.Sync.PubSub.subscribe/1, reason: :eperm`.
- `mix precommit` ❌  
  Same `Mix.PubSub` TCP socket `:eperm` failure (after formatting step passed).
- `rg -n '^### ST-[A-Z]+-[0-9]{3}' specs/stories/*.md` ✅  
  Returned all expected story headings.
- Static validation scripts ✅  
  Verified `story_ids=36`, `matrix_ids=36`, `ids_match=true`, `matrix_duplicates=[]`, section contract valid, and loop usage path strings present.

3) acceptance criteria coverage
- `specs/stories/00_traceability_matrix.md` exists and includes every ST ID: covered by `backlog scaffold files exist` + new matrix parity test in `test/jido_ai/stable_smoke_test.exs:51`.
- Story files `01` through `06` exist with required section headings: covered by existing file-existence test and new section-contract test in `test/jido_ai/stable_smoke_test.exs:33`.
- `rg -n '^### ST-[A-Z]+-[0-9]{3}' specs/stories/*.md` returns all expected IDs: command executed and output verified; parity also enforced by test helpers in `test/jido_ai/stable_smoke_test.exs:131`.
- Loop usage text references executable path in repo layout: covered by new assertions in `test/jido_ai/stable_smoke_test.exs:74`.
- Story examples reference real repo paths: covered for ST-OPS-001 card paths in `test/jido_ai/stable_smoke_test.exs:83`.

4) blockers/assumptions
- Blocker: `mix test.fast` and full `mix precommit` cannot complete in this environment because Mix requires opening a local TCP socket for `Mix.PubSub`, which is denied (`:eperm`).
- Assumption: ST-OPS-001 scaffolding docs/matrix were already present in-repo; implementation focused on enforcing that contract with stable smoke tests only (no other story scope changes).

1) changed files
- `CONTRIBUTING.md:5`  
  Added a dual-gate contributor workflow with explicit runtime budgets and command sets for fast per-story and full checkpoint gates.
- `lib/examples/README.md:5`  
  Added a “Story Loop Gates” section with fast/full command sets and expected runtime budgets.
- `specs/stories/01_ops_examples_core.md:32`  
  Updated only the `ST-OPS-002` card to make budgets and fast/full gate command sets explicit in Acceptance/Stable Test/Docs/Example sections.
- `test/jido_ai/stable_smoke_test.exs:103`  
  Strengthened alias contract assertions (`:test`, `:"test.fast"`, `:precommit`) and added doc assertions for dual-gate behavior, budgets, and command sets.

2) tests/commands executed
- `mix format` ✅ passed
- `mix test.fast` ❌ failed in this sandbox: `Mix.Sync.PubSub.subscribe/1` cannot open TCP socket (`:eperm`)
- `MIX_NO_PUBSUB=1 mix test.fast` ❌ same failure
- `mix precommit` ❌ same failure (`Mix.PubSub` startup blocked by sandbox TCP restriction)

3) acceptance criteria coverage
- `mix precommit` exists: already present in `mix.exs`; now additionally enforced by smoke test alias contract.
- `mix test.fast` exists and targets fast stable smoke: enforced by exact alias assertion (`--exclude flaky --only stable_smoke`).
- Full stable path remains via `mix test` (`--exclude flaky`): enforced by exact alias assertion.
- Docs gate: implemented and test-covered via `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `lib/examples/README.md`, and `specs/stories/01_ops_examples_core.md` budget/dual-gate checks.
- Example gate: implemented with explicit fast/full command sets in examples docs and story card, and test-covered.

4) blockers/assumptions
- Blocker: this environment disallows local TCP sockets, so Mix PubSub cannot start; therefore `mix test.fast` and `mix precommit` cannot be executed to completion here.
- Assumption used for this story’s runtime budgets: warm-cache targets of under 90 seconds (fast gate) and under 10 minutes (full checkpoint gate).

2) tests/commands executed
- `mix format`
- `mix precommit` (passed)
- `mix test.fast` (passed)
- `mix test test/jido_ai/examples/weather_strategy_suite_test.exs` (passed, 6 tests)
- `mix docs` (passed; emitted warning: `index.html redirects to readme.html, which does not exist`)

Note: due sandbox TCP restrictions, I ran the mix commands through a temporary local wrapper (`/tmp/mix_wrapper`) + temporary override beam (`/tmp/mix_sync_pubsub_override`) and `MIX_OS_CONCURRENCY_LOCK=0`. No repo files were added for this workaround.

3) acceptance criteria coverage
- Strategy markdown normalized under `lib/examples/strategies` for CoD/AoT/CoT/ReAct/ToT/GoT/TRM/Adaptive via canonical files: `cod.md`, `aot.md`, `cot.md`, `react.md`, `tot.md`, `got.md`, `trm.md`, `adaptive.md`.
- Weather example index now has a single matrix in `lib/examples/README.md` including CoD parity with all other strategies.
- Docs extras and README links updated to normalized paths:
  - `mix.exs` `docs.extras` now points to normalized strategy markdown files.
  - Root `README.md` and `lib/examples/README.md` now reference normalized strategy paths.
- Added/updated tests in `test/jido_ai/examples/weather_strategy_suite_test.exs` to assert:
  - normalized strategy docs exist and legacy paths are removed,
  - weather matrix includes all strategy demos (including CoD),
  - docs extras and README files use normalized paths,
  - scripts index is categorized as canonical demo vs utility verification.

4) blockers/assumptions
- Blocker: direct `mix` execution in this sandbox fails on loopback TCP (`:eperm`) from Mix PubSub/lock internals.
- Assumption: “normalized strategy markdown” means canonical short strategy IDs (`cod/aot/cot/react/tot/got/trm/adaptive`) under `lib/examples/strategies`.
- No commit, no push, no PR were performed.

3) acceptance criteria coverage
- Skills docs include lifecycle and failure-mode guidance:
  - Expanded lifecycle, CLI surface, and failure-mode sections in `guides/developer/skills_system.md`.
  - Added user-facing skill CLI error handling notes in `guides/user/cli_workflows.md`.
- Skills runtime tests include happy path, validation failure, and registry lifecycle:
  - Added `test/jido_ai/skill/runtime_contracts_test.exs` with explicit cases for all three.
  - Added shipped `priv/skills/**/SKILL.md` validation coverage in the same test file.
- `mix jido_ai.skill` command surface and error handling covered:
  - Added `test/jido_ai/skill/mix_task_test.exs` covering `list/show/validate`, JSON output, usage errors, strict-mode failure, and unknown command handling.
- Skill demos/scripts current and prerequisites clear:
  - Added explicit prerequisites/skip-path notes in `lib/examples/scripts/skill_demo.exs`.
  - Added prerequisites/skip behavior documentation for skill scripts in `lib/examples/README.md`.

4) blockers/assumptions
- Blocker: this sandbox denies local TCP socket creation for some Mix task paths, causing `Mix.PubSub` startup failures (`failed to open a TCP socket ... reason: :eperm`). This prevented completing `mix precommit`, `mix test.fast` alias, docs gate, and example gate commands exactly as requested.
- Assumption: `MIX_ENV=test mix test --exclude flaky --only stable_smoke` is a valid execution of the `test.fast` test target semantics (the alias itself failed due environment-level `Mix.PubSub` restrictions, not project code).

- `MIX_NO_PUBSUB=1 mix precommit` ❌ (same Mix.PubSub `:eperm`)

3) acceptance criteria coverage
- Core runtime guides now map directly to modules and tests:
  - Added runtime contract map and test map in `guides/user/request_lifecycle_and_concurrency.md`.
  - Added directive-to-signal map and parity test map in `guides/developer/directives_runtime_contract.md`.
- Tests now assert happy path, busy/rejection path, and lifecycle completion:
  - `test/jido_ai/request_test.exs`: added end-to-end request contract tests for `create_and_send/3`, `await/2` success/failure/timeout normalization, and `await_many/2` concurrency order.
  - `test/jido_ai/integration/request_lifecycle_parity_test.exs`: added happy-path acceptance checks across strategies, retained busy rejection checks, and added lifecycle completion/failure signal parity assertions (`ai.request.started`, `ai.request.completed`, `ai.request.failed`) for ChainOfThought.
- Contract drift reduction:
  - `lib/jido_ai/request.ex` now normalizes AgentServer timeout diagnostics to `{:error, :timeout}` to align runtime behavior with documented contract.
  - Integration tests assert emitted signal types and request_id correlation.
- Example gate:
  - Added refreshed runtime-focused snippet in `guides/user/request_lifecycle_and_concurrency.md` using `Request` + `Thread` + `Turn`.

4) blockers/assumptions
- Blocker: `mix doctor --summary`, `mix test.fast` alias, and `mix precommit` are not runnable in this sandbox due Mix PubSub TCP socket permission errors (`:eperm`) in those execution paths.
- Assumption: running the equivalent stable-smoke command and story-specific runtime test gates is acceptable proof for ST-RTC-001 under this environment limitation.
