1) changed files
- `test/jido_ai/stable_smoke_test.exs:7`  
Added ST-OPS-001 smoke coverage for:
- required story-card section contract (`Goal`, `Scope`, `Acceptance Criteria`, `Stable Test Gate`, `Docs Gate`, `Example Gate`, `Dependencies`)
- traceability matrix ID parity and duplicate prevention
- `ralph_wiggum_loop.sh` usage/example path assertions
- ST-OPS-001 repo-path reference assertions in `specs/stories/01_ops_examples_core.md`

2) tests/commands executed
- `mix format test/jido_ai/stable_smoke_test.exs` ✅
- `mix format --check-formatted` ✅
- `mix compile --warnings-as-errors` ✅
- `mix test.fast` ❌  
  Failed in this sandbox with `failed to open a TCP socket in Mix.Sync.PubSub.subscribe/1, reason: :eperm`.
- `mix precommit` ❌  
  Same `Mix.PubSub` TCP socket `:eperm` failure (after formatting step passed).
- `rg -n '^### ST-[A-Z]+-[0-9]{3}' specs/stories/*.md` ✅  
  Returned all expected story headings.
- Static validation scripts ✅  
  Verified `story_ids=36`, `matrix_ids=36`, `ids_match=true`, `matrix_duplicates=[]`, section contract valid, and loop usage path strings present.

3) acceptance criteria coverage
- `specs/stories/00_traceability_matrix.md` exists and includes every ST ID: covered by `backlog scaffold files exist` + new matrix parity test in `test/jido_ai/stable_smoke_test.exs:51`.
- Story files `01` through `06` exist with required section headings: covered by existing file-existence test and new section-contract test in `test/jido_ai/stable_smoke_test.exs:33`.
- `rg -n '^### ST-[A-Z]+-[0-9]{3}' specs/stories/*.md` returns all expected IDs: command executed and output verified; parity also enforced by test helpers in `test/jido_ai/stable_smoke_test.exs:131`.
- Loop usage text references executable path in repo layout: covered by new assertions in `test/jido_ai/stable_smoke_test.exs:74`.
- Story examples reference real repo paths: covered for ST-OPS-001 card paths in `test/jido_ai/stable_smoke_test.exs:83`.

4) blockers/assumptions
- Blocker: `mix test.fast` and full `mix precommit` cannot complete in this environment because Mix requires opening a local TCP socket for `Mix.PubSub`, which is denied (`:eperm`).
- Assumption: ST-OPS-001 scaffolding docs/matrix were already present in-repo; implementation focused on enforcing that contract with stable smoke tests only (no other story scope changes).

1) changed files
- `CONTRIBUTING.md:5`  
  Added a dual-gate contributor workflow with explicit runtime budgets and command sets for fast per-story and full checkpoint gates.
- `lib/examples/README.md:5`  
  Added a “Story Loop Gates” section with fast/full command sets and expected runtime budgets.
- `specs/stories/01_ops_examples_core.md:32`  
  Updated only the `ST-OPS-002` card to make budgets and fast/full gate command sets explicit in Acceptance/Stable Test/Docs/Example sections.
- `test/jido_ai/stable_smoke_test.exs:103`  
  Strengthened alias contract assertions (`:test`, `:"test.fast"`, `:precommit`) and added doc assertions for dual-gate behavior, budgets, and command sets.

2) tests/commands executed
- `mix format` ✅ passed
- `mix test.fast` ❌ failed in this sandbox: `Mix.Sync.PubSub.subscribe/1` cannot open TCP socket (`:eperm`)
- `MIX_NO_PUBSUB=1 mix test.fast` ❌ same failure
- `mix precommit` ❌ same failure (`Mix.PubSub` startup blocked by sandbox TCP restriction)

3) acceptance criteria coverage
- `mix precommit` exists: already present in `mix.exs`; now additionally enforced by smoke test alias contract.
- `mix test.fast` exists and targets fast stable smoke: enforced by exact alias assertion (`--exclude flaky --only stable_smoke`).
- Full stable path remains via `mix test` (`--exclude flaky`): enforced by exact alias assertion.
- Docs gate: implemented and test-covered via `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `lib/examples/README.md`, and `specs/stories/01_ops_examples_core.md` budget/dual-gate checks.
- Example gate: implemented with explicit fast/full command sets in examples docs and story card, and test-covered.

4) blockers/assumptions
- Blocker: this environment disallows local TCP sockets, so Mix PubSub cannot start; therefore `mix test.fast` and `mix precommit` cannot be executed to completion here.
- Assumption used for this story’s runtime budgets: warm-cache targets of under 90 seconds (fast gate) and under 10 minutes (full checkpoint gate).

- `mix test test/jido_ai/examples/weather_strategy_suite_test.exs` (passed, 6 tests)
- `mix docs` (passed; emitted warning: `index.html redirects to readme.html, which does not exist`)

Note: due sandbox TCP restrictions, I ran the mix commands through a temporary local wrapper (`/tmp/mix_wrapper`) + temporary override beam (`/tmp/mix_sync_pubsub_override`) and `MIX_OS_CONCURRENCY_LOCK=0`. No repo files were added for this workaround.

3) acceptance criteria coverage
- Strategy markdown normalized under `lib/examples/strategies` for CoD/AoT/CoT/ReAct/ToT/GoT/TRM/Adaptive via canonical files: `cod.md`, `aot.md`, `cot.md`, `react.md`, `tot.md`, `got.md`, `trm.md`, `adaptive.md`.
- Weather example index now has a single matrix in `lib/examples/README.md` including CoD parity with all other strategies.
- Docs extras and README links updated to normalized paths:
  - `mix.exs` `docs.extras` now points to normalized strategy markdown files.
  - Root `README.md` and `lib/examples/README.md` now reference normalized strategy paths.
- Added/updated tests in `test/jido_ai/examples/weather_strategy_suite_test.exs` to assert:
  - normalized strategy docs exist and legacy paths are removed,
  - weather matrix includes all strategy demos (including CoD),
  - docs extras and README files use normalized paths,
  - scripts index is categorized as canonical demo vs utility verification.

4) blockers/assumptions
- Blocker: direct `mix` execution in this sandbox fails on loopback TCP (`:eperm`) from Mix PubSub/lock internals.
- Assumption: “normalized strategy markdown” means canonical short strategy IDs (`cod/aot/cot/react/tot/got/trm/adaptive`) under `lib/examples/strategies`.
- No commit, no push, no PR were performed.

3) acceptance criteria coverage
- Skills docs include lifecycle and failure-mode guidance:
  - Expanded lifecycle, CLI surface, and failure-mode sections in `guides/developer/skills_system.md`.
  - Added user-facing skill CLI error handling notes in `guides/user/cli_workflows.md`.
- Skills runtime tests include happy path, validation failure, and registry lifecycle:
  - Added `test/jido_ai/skill/runtime_contracts_test.exs` with explicit cases for all three.
  - Added shipped `priv/skills/**/SKILL.md` validation coverage in the same test file.
- `mix jido_ai.skill` command surface and error handling covered:
  - Added `test/jido_ai/skill/mix_task_test.exs` covering `list/show/validate`, JSON output, usage errors, strict-mode failure, and unknown command handling.
- Skill demos/scripts current and prerequisites clear:
  - Added explicit prerequisites/skip-path notes in `lib/examples/scripts/skill_demo.exs`.
  - Added prerequisites/skip behavior documentation for skill scripts in `lib/examples/README.md`.

4) blockers/assumptions
- Blocker: this sandbox denies local TCP socket creation for some Mix task paths, causing `Mix.PubSub` startup failures (`failed to open a TCP socket ... reason: :eperm`). This prevented completing `mix precommit`, `mix test.fast` alias, docs gate, and example gate commands exactly as requested.
- Assumption: `MIX_ENV=test mix test --exclude flaky --only stable_smoke` is a valid execution of the `test.fast` test target semantics (the alias itself failed due environment-level `Mix.PubSub` restrictions, not project code).

- `MIX_NO_PUBSUB=1 mix precommit` ❌ (same Mix.PubSub `:eperm`)

3) acceptance criteria coverage
- Core runtime guides now map directly to modules and tests:
  - Added runtime contract map and test map in `guides/user/request_lifecycle_and_concurrency.md`.
  - Added directive-to-signal map and parity test map in `guides/developer/directives_runtime_contract.md`.
- Tests now assert happy path, busy/rejection path, and lifecycle completion:
  - `test/jido_ai/request_test.exs`: added end-to-end request contract tests for `create_and_send/3`, `await/2` success/failure/timeout normalization, and `await_many/2` concurrency order.
  - `test/jido_ai/integration/request_lifecycle_parity_test.exs`: added happy-path acceptance checks across strategies, retained busy rejection checks, and added lifecycle completion/failure signal parity assertions (`ai.request.started`, `ai.request.completed`, `ai.request.failed`) for ChainOfThought.
- Contract drift reduction:
  - `lib/jido_ai/request.ex` now normalizes AgentServer timeout diagnostics to `{:error, :timeout}` to align runtime behavior with documented contract.
  - Integration tests assert emitted signal types and request_id correlation.
- Example gate:
  - Added refreshed runtime-focused snippet in `guides/user/request_lifecycle_and_concurrency.md` using `Request` + `Thread` + `Turn`.

4) blockers/assumptions
- Blocker: `mix doctor --summary`, `mix test.fast` alias, and `mix precommit` are not runnable in this sandbox due Mix PubSub TCP socket permission errors (`:eperm`) in those execution paths.
- Assumption: running the equivalent stable-smoke command and story-specific runtime test gates is acceptable proof for ST-RTC-001 under this environment limitation.

3) acceptance criteria coverage
- Signal namespace contract docs match emitted signal types:
  - Updated `guides/developer/signals_namespaces_contracts.md` with explicit canonical signal strings and module-to-type mapping.
  - Added contract parity test in `test/jido_ai/signal_test.exs` that asserts docs include canonical emitted types.
- Security and sanitization tests cover sensitive/error edge cases:
  - Added nested recursive redaction coverage in `test/jido_ai/observe_test.exs`.
  - Added edge-case sanitization tests in `test/jido_ai/error/sanitize_test.exs` (tuple reasons, unknown reasons, verbose/include_code behavior, user/log split).
  - Added validation hardening tests in `test/jido_ai/validation_test.exs` (dangerous bytes, allowlist override, invalid/missing supervisors, empty-string + control-byte handling).
- Observability behavior has clear enable/disable and metadata contract docs:
  - Updated `guides/user/observability_basics.md` with:
    - valid telemetry event namespaces
    - required metadata/measurement keys
    - enable/disable semantics (`emit_telemetry?`, `emit_llm_deltas?`, span `:noop`)
    - corrected telemetry subscribe example path.
- Example gate:
  - Added telemetry + signal snippet in `guides/user/observability_basics.md` using `Jido.AI.Signal.RequestStarted` + `Jido.AI.Observe.emit/5`.

4) blockers/assumptions
- Blocker: in this execution environment, `mix doctor --summary`, `mix precommit`, and alias `mix test.fast` cannot complete because `Mix.PubSub` cannot open loopback TCP sockets (`:eperm`).
- Assumption: “signal namespace contract” refers to documented canonical/public runtime signal contracts plus explicit internal ReAct worker control signals (documented as separate internal namespace).

3. acceptance criteria coverage
- CLI docs include one-shot, stdin, and agent-module coverage:
  - `guides/user/cli_workflows.md` now explicitly documents all three modes.
- Adapter tests cover default + custom config for each strategy type:
  - Added ReAct adapter test with default/custom assertions (`test/jido_ai/cli/adapters/react_test.exs`).
  - Strengthened CoD defaults (`test/jido_ai/cli/adapters/cod_test.exs`).
  - Existing AoT/Adaptive/CoD/CoT/ToT/GoT/TRM tests retained.
  - Added explicit type-to-adapter mapping tests for full supported set (`test/jido_ai/cli/adapters/adapter_resolution_test.exs`).
- CLI task options and error formatting coverage:
  - Exposed/tested `option_parser_config/0`, `build_config/1`, `format_error/1`, and supported type list in `Mix.Tasks.JidoAi`.
  - Added contract tests in `test/jido_ai/cli/adapters/mix_task_contract_test.exs`.
- No stale paths or unsupported flags in CLI guide:
  - Added guide contract tests for link validity and flag allowlist (`test/jido_ai/cli/adapters/guide_workflows_test.exs`).
- Example gate (`mix jido_ai --type <strategy>`) coverage:
  - Added “Strategy Type Sweep” guide block in `guides/user/cli_workflows.md`.

4. blockers/assumptions
- Blocker: this sandbox denies the TCP socket Mix PubSub uses for certain task paths (`:eperm`), which prevents `mix doctor --summary`, `mix test.fast` alias path, and `mix precommit` from completing as-is.
- Assumption/workaround used: executed equivalent underlying stable-smoke test command directly (`MIX_ENV=test mix test --exclude flaky --only stable_smoke`) and validated doctor summary logic via direct Elixir invocation with dev build paths.
- No commit/push/PR was performed.

3) acceptance criteria coverage
- ReAct docs now include tool loop flow and request lifecycle contracts:
  - expanded `lib/examples/strategies/react.md` with explicit delegated flow, lifecycle API contract, CLI adapter alignment, and example gate/skip guidance.
- Tests cover behavior, error path, and runtime runner integration:
  - added regression test for terminal checkpoint handling in `test/jido_ai/strategy/react_test.exs`.
  - added end-to-end strategy+runtime-runner integration test in `test/jido_ai/react/runtime_runner_test.exs`.
  - added ReAct docs/index contract tests in `test/jido_ai/react/docs_contract_test.exs`.
  - added weather ReAct adapter/parity assertions in `test/jido_ai/react_agent_test.exs`.
- Weather example is current and linked from docs index:
  - updated `README.md` ReAct production defaults to `lib/examples/weather/react_agent.ex` and `lib/examples/weather/overview.ex`.
  - kept/weather-verified references in examples index (`lib/examples/README.md`) and enforced via tests.

4) blockers/assumptions
- Environment-level restriction blocks loopback TCP socket creation for `Mix.Sync.PubSub` (`:eperm`) on several Mix tasks, so `mix precommit`, `mix doctor --summary`, `mix test.fast` alias, and `mix run ...` could not complete in this sandbox.
- Equivalent stable smoke test was run directly, and a documented skip path for the weather script gate was added in `lib/examples/strategies/react.md`.

- CoD docs/tests cover happy path, error path, adapter wiring:
  - happy path already covered (`request_completed` extraction test)
  - error path now explicitly covered in `chain_of_draft_test.exs`
  - adapter wiring now explicitly covered in `cod_test.exs`
  - docs now include runtime flow + CLI adapter alignment in `lib/examples/strategies/cod.md`
- Strategy markdown under normalized path: `lib/examples/strategies/cod.md` retained and validated by existing weather strategy suite checks.
- Weather matrix includes CoD command/module reference: validated by existing `weather_strategy_suite_test.exs`.

4) blockers/assumptions
- Blocker: this sandbox disallows Mix PubSub TCP listen (`Mix.Sync.PubSub.subscribe/1` -> `:eperm`), so `mix doctor --summary`, `mix test.fast`, and `mix precommit` cannot complete here.
- Assumption: existing `Jido.AI.Examples.Weather.CoDAgent` + `lib/examples/weather/overview.ex` wiring was already correct for ST-STR-002 and did not require functional changes.

3) acceptance criteria coverage
- CoT docs/tests align with request lifecycle behavior:
  - Expanded CoT strategy doc flow + lifecycle contract in `lib/examples/strategies/cot.md`.
  - Added explicit lifecycle contract sections in CoT macro and strategy moduledocs.
  - Added lifecycle edge tests for `request_cancelled` and stored rejection metadata in `test/jido_ai/strategy/chain_of_thought_test.exs`.
  - Added CoT docs contract test in `test/jido_ai/cot/docs_contract_test.exs`.
  - Added macro docs contract + strategy option/default coverage in `test/jido_ai/cot_agent_test.exs`.
- Weather CoT example remains canonical and linked in strategy matrix:
  - `lib/examples/strategies/cot.md` references canonical module and CLI command.
  - `test/jido_ai/cot/docs_contract_test.exs` asserts matrix row/module/doc/command in `lib/examples/README.md`.
- CLI adapter tests cover default/custom options:
  - Extended `test/jido_ai/cli/adapters/cot_test.exs` for default model/no system prompt, custom model, custom system prompt, submit delegation, timeout behavior, and weather adapter resolution.

4) blockers/assumptions
- Blocker: this sandbox denies loopback TCP socket creation for Mix PubSub (`Mix.Sync.PubSub.subscribe/1`, `:eperm`), which prevents `mix precommit`, `mix test.fast`, and `mix doctor --summary` from running here.
- Assumption: weather strategy matrix source of truth is `lib/examples/README.md` (validated by new docs-contract test).

3) acceptance criteria coverage
- AoT tests cover options/defaults/request lifecycle behavior:
  - Expanded `test/jido_ai/strategy/algorithm_of_thoughts_test.exs` with request-id correlation on start, busy second-request rejection directive checks, and `aot_request_error` lifecycle metadata persistence.
  - Existing `test/jido_ai/aot_agent_test.exs` and `test/jido_ai/cli/adapters/aot_test.exs` already validate defaults/custom options.
- AoT example path normalized and linked consistently:
  - Deleted legacy path `examples/strategies/algorithm_of_thoughts.md`.
  - Added assertions in `test/jido_ai/examples/weather_strategy_suite_test.exs` and new `test/jido_ai/aot/docs_contract_test.exs` to enforce normalized `lib/examples/strategies/aot.md` usage.
- Weather example module validated in suite tests:
  - Strengthened `test/jido_ai/examples/weather_strategy_suite_test.exs` with explicit AoT matrix row and canonical AoT weather command checks.
- Strategy matrix includes AoT weather run command:
  - Enforced by `test/jido_ai/examples/weather_strategy_suite_test.exs` and `test/jido_ai/aot/docs_contract_test.exs`.

4) blockers/assumptions
- Blocker: this sandbox denies loopback TCP sockets, and Mix tasks that start `Mix.PubSub` fail with `:eperm`; this prevented `mix precommit`, `mix test.fast` alias, and `mix doctor --summary` from completing here.
- Assumption: running those three commands in a normal local environment (without this socket restriction) is required to fully satisfy the gate exactly as written.

3) acceptance criteria coverage
- ToT docs include structured result fields and control knobs:
  - Added structured contract + control knobs sections in `lib/examples/strategies/tot.md`.
  - Expanded ToT macro/strategy moduledocs in `lib/jido_ai/agents/strategies/tot_agent.ex` and `lib/jido_ai/reasoning/tree_of_thoughts/strategy.ex`.
  - Enforced by new docs test `test/jido_ai/tot/docs_contract_test.exs`.
- Tests cover helper extraction and configuration defaults:
  - Added default/custom config knob assertions in `test/jido_ai/strategy/tree_of_thoughts_test.exs`.
  - Expanded default option assertions and helper shape checks in `test/jido_ai/tot_agent_test.exs`.
  - Added direct helper extraction coverage in `test/jido_ai/tree_of_thoughts/result_test.exs`.
- Weather ToT example usage remains current and linked:
  - Updated ToT example CLI text in `lib/examples/weather/tot_agent.ex`.
  - Aligned ToT strategy markdown command with weather matrix in `lib/examples/strategies/tot.md`.
  - Added linkage assertions in `test/jido_ai/tot/docs_contract_test.exs`.
- Strategy matrix includes ToT weather run command:
  - Verified via docs contract test against `lib/examples/README.md` row/command.

4) blockers/assumptions
- Blocker: In this environment, commands that require `mix doctor`, `mix test.fast` alias, and `mix precommit` fail before task execution due `Mix.Sync.PubSub` attempting a TCP loopback socket and receiving `:eperm`.
- Assumption: Using the direct equivalent stable-smoke command (`MIX_ENV=test mix test --exclude flaky --only stable_smoke`) is a valid substitute for functional verification of the `test.fast` gate in this sandbox.

3) **Acceptance criteria coverage**
- GoT markdown in normalized location: completed via `lib/examples/strategies/got.md` (expanded end-to-end strategy docs content).
- GoT docs extras wiring: covered by new test `test/jido_ai/got/docs_contract_test.exs` asserting `Mix.Project.config()[:docs][:extras]` includes `lib/examples/strategies/got.md`.
- Tests for strategy behavior + macro lifecycle/error hooks:
  - Strategy behavior/error routing added in `test/jido_ai/strategy/graph_of_thoughts_test.exs` (action specs, `ai.request.error` route, busy-start rejection directive, request-error state storage).
  - Macro lifecycle/error hooks expanded in `test/jido_ai/got_agent_test.exs` (`on_before_cmd` start tracking, request-error failure tracking, `on_after_cmd` completion and pass-through behavior).
- Weather GoT example parity: aligned GoT command text in docs/module and asserted matrix command presence in `test/jido_ai/got/docs_contract_test.exs`.

4) **Blockers/assumptions**
- Blocker: this environment denies TCP socket creation for Mix sync pubsub (`Mix.Sync.PubSub.subscribe/1`, `:eperm`), which prevents `mix precommit`, `mix test.fast` alias execution path, and `mix doctor --summary` from completing here.
- Assumption: running those exact commands outside this sandbox (normal local dev shell) should work; code/test changes for ST-STR-006 are in place and targeted GoT suites pass.
