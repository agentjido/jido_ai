1) changed files
- `test/jido_ai/stable_smoke_test.exs:7`  
Added ST-OPS-001 smoke coverage for:
- required story-card section contract (`Goal`, `Scope`, `Acceptance Criteria`, `Stable Test Gate`, `Docs Gate`, `Example Gate`, `Dependencies`)
- traceability matrix ID parity and duplicate prevention
- `ralph_wiggum_loop.sh` usage/example path assertions
- ST-OPS-001 repo-path reference assertions in `specs/stories/01_ops_examples_core.md`

2) tests/commands executed
- `mix format test/jido_ai/stable_smoke_test.exs` ✅
- `mix format --check-formatted` ✅
- `mix compile --warnings-as-errors` ✅
- `mix test.fast` ❌  
  Failed in this sandbox with `failed to open a TCP socket in Mix.Sync.PubSub.subscribe/1, reason: :eperm`.
- `mix precommit` ❌  
  Same `Mix.PubSub` TCP socket `:eperm` failure (after formatting step passed).
- `rg -n '^### ST-[A-Z]+-[0-9]{3}' specs/stories/*.md` ✅  
  Returned all expected story headings.
- Static validation scripts ✅  
  Verified `story_ids=36`, `matrix_ids=36`, `ids_match=true`, `matrix_duplicates=[]`, section contract valid, and loop usage path strings present.

3) acceptance criteria coverage
- `specs/stories/00_traceability_matrix.md` exists and includes every ST ID: covered by `backlog scaffold files exist` + new matrix parity test in `test/jido_ai/stable_smoke_test.exs:51`.
- Story files `01` through `06` exist with required section headings: covered by existing file-existence test and new section-contract test in `test/jido_ai/stable_smoke_test.exs:33`.
- `rg -n '^### ST-[A-Z]+-[0-9]{3}' specs/stories/*.md` returns all expected IDs: command executed and output verified; parity also enforced by test helpers in `test/jido_ai/stable_smoke_test.exs:131`.
- Loop usage text references executable path in repo layout: covered by new assertions in `test/jido_ai/stable_smoke_test.exs:74`.
- Story examples reference real repo paths: covered for ST-OPS-001 card paths in `test/jido_ai/stable_smoke_test.exs:83`.

4) blockers/assumptions
- Blocker: `mix test.fast` and full `mix precommit` cannot complete in this environment because Mix requires opening a local TCP socket for `Mix.PubSub`, which is denied (`:eperm`).
- Assumption: ST-OPS-001 scaffolding docs/matrix were already present in-repo; implementation focused on enforcing that contract with stable smoke tests only (no other story scope changes).
