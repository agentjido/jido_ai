# Pull Request Review

Conducts a comprehensive pull request review comparing the current branch against main, verifying implementation matches planning documents and meets quality standards.

## Workflow

### 1. Context Gathering

Analyze the pull request context:

```bash
# Get current branch
git branch --show-current

# Show diff summary against main
git diff main --stat

# List changed files
git diff main --name-only
```

Locate and read the planning document:
- Feature branches ‚Üí `notes/features/<feature_name>.md`
- Fix branches ‚Üí `notes/fixes/<fix_name>.md`
- Task branches ‚Üí `notes/tasks/<task_name>.md`

### 2. Parallel Review Agent Execution

Run all applicable review agents simultaneously for multi-perspective analysis:

#### Core Review Agents (Always Run)

**`factual-reviewer`**: Implementation vs Planning Verification
- Compares actual implementation against planning document
- Identifies deviations from documented requirements
- Verifies claimed functionality is implemented
- Checks if success criteria are met

**`qa-reviewer`**: Testing Coverage and Quality
- Analyzes test coverage for new features
- Verifies edge cases and error scenarios
- Checks test quality and effectiveness
- Identifies missing test scenarios

**`senior-engineer-reviewer`**: Architecture and Design
- Assesses architectural decisions
- Reviews system integration
- Evaluates long-term maintainability
- Checks scalability implications

**`security-reviewer`**: Security Analysis
- Identifies potential vulnerabilities
- Reviews authentication/authorization
- Checks for exposed secrets
- Validates input sanitization

**`consistency-reviewer`**: Pattern Consistency
- Verifies adherence to codebase patterns
- Checks naming conventions
- Reviews code organization
- Ensures style consistency

**`redundancy-reviewer`**: Code Duplication
- Identifies duplicate code blocks
- Finds refactoring opportunities
- Suggests consolidation approaches
- Reviews code efficiency

#### Language-Specific Reviewers

**For Elixir/Phoenix/Ash/Ecto changes:**

**`elixir-reviewer`**: Comprehensive Elixir Analysis
- Runs `mix format --check-formatted`
- Executes `mix credo --strict`
- Performs `mix dialyzer` analysis
- Security scan with `mix sobelow`
- Dependency audit with `mix deps.audit`
- Test execution and coverage analysis

**`documentation-reviewer`**: Documentation Quality
- Verifies documentation completeness
- Checks README updates
- Reviews inline documentation
- Validates API documentation

### 3. Review Synthesis

After all agents complete their analysis, synthesize findings into a comprehensive report:

```markdown
