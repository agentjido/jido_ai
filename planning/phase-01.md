# Phase 1: Core ReqLLM Integration Infrastructure

## Overview
This phase establishes the foundational infrastructure to integrate ReqLLM into Jido AI while preserving all existing public APIs and behavior. We follow the research document's migration strategy to replace provider-specific implementations with ReqLLM's unified interface. The goal is to create a seamless transition where existing Jido AI users experience no breaking changes while gaining access to ReqLLM's broader provider and model ecosystem.

The integration maintains Jido AI's philosophy of minimal, opt-in logging and preserves all existing error handling patterns. By the end of this phase, all current Jido AI functionality will be powered by ReqLLM internally, but externally indistinguishable from the current implementation.

### Benefits of JidoKeys Integration

**Security Enhancement**:
- Built-in credential filtering prevents accidental exposure in logs
- Automatic redaction of sensitive patterns (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- Safe atom conversion with hardcoded allowlists for untrusted input

**API Preservation**:
- Maintain all existing `Jido.AI.Keyring` functions and method signatures
- Preserve process isolation and session management capabilities
- No breaking changes to existing applications or test suites

**Enhanced Functionality**:
- Runtime configuration updates through JidoKeys.put/2 for global settings
- Improved error handling with specific error types and better messaging
- Livebook integration with LB_ prefix handling for development environments

### Implementation Strategy

The hybrid approach uses JidoKeys as the backend for global configuration while Jido.AI.Keyring provides process-specific session management:

```elixir
# Delegation pattern for basic operations
defmodule Jido.AI.Keyring do
  # Basic get/2 delegates to JidoKeys for global config
  def get(server \\ __MODULE__, key, default \\ nil) do
    case get_session_value(server, key) do
      nil -> JidoKeys.get(key, default)  # Fall back to JidoKeys
      value -> value  # Use session override
    end
  end

  # Session functions remain unchanged for process isolation
  def set_session_value(server, key, value, pid), do: # existing implementation
end
```

**Configuration Hierarchy with JidoKeys Backend**:
1. Session values (per-process) - handled by Jido.AI.Keyring
2. JidoKeys runtime overrides - handled by JidoKeys.put/2
3. Environment variables - handled by JidoKeys
4. Application config - handled by JidoKeys
5. Default values - provided by calling code
