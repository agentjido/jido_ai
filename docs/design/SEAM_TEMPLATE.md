# Jido AI architectural seam template

Use this template for each numbered folder under `docs/design`.

Follow [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). The review table in [README.md](README.md) is
the source of truth for approval. Use [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for
the current module and ownership map. Preserve advanced target work and stable
requirement IDs; unimplemented does not mean rejected.

The top-level `docs/design/README.md` owns the seam dependency tree,
build order, and document index. An individual seam README owns only its direct
prerequisites, dependents, and blockers.

## Required files

```text
<NN_seam>/
  README.md
  design.md
  alignment.md
```

Use only these three files by default:

- `README.md` is the briefing and review entry point.
- `design.md` is the target contract.
- `alignment.md` connects canonical code to the target contract.

During initial seam approval, a folder can contain only `README.md`. Mark the
other documents as not created. Create them only after the seam name, owner,
scope, and dependencies are approved.

Do not add separate `briefing.md`, `gap-analysis.md`, or `evidence.md` files.
Put that content in the sections below. Add a supporting topic document only
when it defines a large independent contract that would make `design.md`
difficult to review.

## `README.md` template

Keep this file at 1,200 words or less.

```markdown
> Seam review entry point. This document is pending approval.

# <NN> — <Seam name>

## Briefing

<One paragraph. State the current position, the recommended target, and the
main change.>

## Why this seam exists

- Owner: `<owning module or subsystem>`
- Owns: <short list>
- Does not own: <short list>

## Current and target state

| Area | Current | Target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| <contract> | <implemented fact> | <recommended result> |

## Major gaps and work remaining

| Gap | Why it matters | Required outcome | Owner seam |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <short gap> | <effect> | <result, not implementation tasks> | <seam> |

## Decisions requested

1. **<Decision name>:** Approve <recommended option>.
   Effect: <what this decision enables or prevents>.

## Dependencies

- Prerequisites: <approved seam alignment links, or `None`>
- Dependents: <seams that use this contract>
- Blockers: <unresolved prerequisite decisions, or `None`>

## Documents

- Target design: Not created.
- Alignment plan: Not created.
```

After both later documents exist, replace the last section with:

```markdown
## Documents

- [Target design](design.md)
- [Alignment plan](alignment.md)
```

## `design.md` template

This file states the planned end state. Do not put implementation history or a
phase plan here.

```markdown
> Target seam design. This document is pending approval.

# <Seam name> design

## Scope and owner

- Owner: `<module or subsystem>`
- In scope: <owned concepts>
- Out of scope: <concepts owned by other seams>

## Model

<Define values, state, boundaries, and information flow. Add one small diagram
only when it makes ownership or sequence clearer.>

## Requirements

### <Requirement group>

`<SEAM>-REQ-001`: When <trigger>, the <owner> shall <observable response>.

`<SEAM>-REQ-002`: The <owner> shall <observable response>.

## Public contract

<Define public values, functions, callbacks, errors, and compatibility rules.
Use signatures only when they make the contract clearer.>

## Invariants

- `<SEAM>-INV-001`: <condition that must always remain true>.

## Downstream guarantees

| Consumer seam | Guaranteed contract |
| --- | --- |
| <seam> | <what it can rely on> |

## Open design decisions

| ID | Question | Recommended option | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<SEAM>-DEC-001` | <small decision> | <recommendation> | <effect> |
```

## `alignment.md` template

This file is the working plan. It records current evidence, gaps, and the path
to the target. Delete superseded analysis after its unique evidence is present
here.

```markdown
> Seam alignment plan. This document is pending approval.

# <Seam name> alignment

## Status

- Design reviewed: <commit or date>
- Code reviewed: <branch, commit, and relevant uncommitted changes>
- Prerequisite alignments: <links or `None`>
- Alignment state: `Draft`, `Blocked`, `Ready`, or `Complete`

The alignment state is execution status. It is not document approval.
Record whether tests were rerun or are referenced prior evidence. Use the
evidence states from the main README, including `Not revalidated` for old
assessments. Do not carry an old compile blocker or `Proven` label forward
without checking its evidence.

## Inputs and evidence

### Design

- `<path>`: <reason>

### Canonical code

- `<path:line>`: <implemented behavior>

### Tests and examples

- `<path:line>`: <behavior proved>

## Retained baseline

<List supported behavior that the plan will preserve.>

## Gap register

| Gap | Requirement | Current evidence | Difference | Disposition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<SEAM>-GAP-001` | `<SEAM>-REQ-001` | `<path:line>` | <gap> | `Retain`, `Change`, `Defer`, or `Remove` |

## High-level work sequence

This sequence defines outcomes and gates. It is not an implementation plan.
Create the implementation plan only after the design is approved.

### Phase 0 — Resolve prerequisites

- Contract change: <decision or none>
- Compatibility: <effect>
- Verification: <test or review>
- Exit criteria: <observable result>

### Phase 1 — <Small outcome>

- Requirements: `<SEAM>-REQ-001`
- Required outcome: <result>
- Constraints: <contracts that the later implementation plan must preserve>
- Compatibility: <migration>
- Verification: <tests>
- Exit criteria: <observable result>

## Acceptance matrix

| Requirement | Evidence now | Required evidence | Evidence state |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<SEAM>-REQ-001` | `<path:line>` or `None` | `<test or check>` | <evidence state from the main README> |

## Migration and compatibility

<List deprecations, adapters, data migrations, release gates, and rollback
rules. State `None` when no migration is required.>

## Assumptions and blockers

| ID | Type | Owner | Statement | Resolution needed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<SEAM>-BLK-001` | `Assumption` or `Blocker` | <seam> | <statement> | <decision or evidence> |

## Completion criteria

- [ ] All approved requirements are `Implemented and evidenced`.
- [ ] No unresolved `Decision required` remains for approved scope.
- [ ] Compatibility work is complete.
- [ ] Dependent seam documents use the approved contract.
```

## Content rules

1. Put each fact in one file only.
2. Link to detail instead of repeating it in the briefing.
3. Use `design.md` for target requirements, not current implementation notes.
4. Use `alignment.md` for current behavior, gaps, evidence, and execution order.
5. Use `README.md` for decisions and a short comparison, not full evidence.
6. Use EARS for every required target behavior.
7. Keep requirement, decision, gap, invariant, and blocker identifiers stable.
8. Treat code in `lib` and executable tests as canonical current behavior.
9. Treat old guides, history, and migration notes as intent or historical evidence.
10. Keep every changed document at `Pending approval` until the user approves it.
11. Do not put implementation tasks in the seam documents. Create an implementation plan after the seam design is approved.
12. Keep Jido AI behavior above the public Jido, Flow, Exec, and Signal boundaries.
13. Keep proposed advanced work visible. Separate evidence gaps, implementation
    gaps, and decisions; do not turn an old proposal into an automatic code task.

## Migration from current documents

For each seam review:

1. Move target contracts from topic documents into `design.md`.
2. Move unique code evidence and gaps into `alignment.md`.
3. Move the briefing summary and decision checklist into `README.md`.
4. Update links to use requirement and gap identifiers.
5. Remove superseded or duplicate topic documents only after their unique content is preserved.
6. Keep Git history as the record of removed drafts and execution reports.
