    "description": "R1 1776 is a version of DeepSeek-R1 that has been post-trained to remove censorship constraints related to topics restricted by the Chinese government. The model retains its original reasoning capabilities while providing direct responses to a wider range of queries. R1 1776 is an offline chat model that does not use the perplexity search subsystem.\n\nThe model was tested on a multilingual dataset of over 1,000 examples covering sensitive topics to measure its likelihood of refusal or overly filtered responses. [Evaluation Results](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/675c8332d01f593dc90817f5/GiN2VqC5hawUgAGJ6oHla.png) Its performance on math and reasoning benchmarks remains similar to the base R1 model.
