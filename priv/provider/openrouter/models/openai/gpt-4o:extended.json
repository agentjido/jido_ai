  "description": "GPT-4o (\"o\" for \"omni\") is OpenAI's latest AI model, supporting both text and image inputs with text outputs. It maintains the intelligence level of [GPT-4 Turbo](/models/openai/gpt-4-turbo) while being twice as fast and 50% more cost-effective. GPT-4o also offers improved performance in processing non-English languages and enhanced visual capabilities.\n\nFor benchmarking against other models, it was briefly called [\"im-also-a-good-gpt2-chatbot\"](https://twitter.com/LiamFedus/status/1790064963966370209)\n\n#multimodal",
