  "description": "GPT-4.5 (Preview) is a research preview of OpenAI’s latest language model, designed to advance capabilities in reasoning, creativity, and multi-turn conversation. It builds on previous iterations with improvements in world knowledge, contextual coherence, and the ability to follow user intent more effectively.\n\nThe model demonstrates enhanced performance in tasks that require open-ended thinking, problem-solving, and communication. Early testing suggests it is better at generating nuanced responses, maintaining long-context coherence, and reducing hallucinations compared to earlier versions.\n\nThis research preview is intended to help evaluate GPT-4.5’s strengths and limitations in real-world use cases as OpenAI continues to refine and develop future models.
