It therefore differs slightly from the API version of [GPT-4o](/models/openai/gpt-4o) in that it has additional RLHF. It is intended for research and evaluation.\n\nOpenAI notes that this model is not suited for production use-cases as it may be removed or redirected to another model in the future.",
