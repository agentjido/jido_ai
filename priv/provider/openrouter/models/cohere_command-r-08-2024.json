    "description": "command-r-08-2024 is an update of the [Command R](/models/cohere/command-r) with improved performance for multilingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and tool use. More broadly, it is better at math, code and reasoning and is competitive with the previous version of the larger Command R+ model.\n\nRead the launch post [here](https://docs.cohere.com/changelog/command-gets-refreshed).\n\nUse of this model is subject to Cohere's [Usage Policy](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/usage-policy) and [SaaS Agreement](https://cohere.com/saas-agreement).",
