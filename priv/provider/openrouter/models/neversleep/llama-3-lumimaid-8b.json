  "description": "The NeverSleep team is back, with a Llama 3 8B finetune trained on their curated roleplay data. Striking a balance between eRP and RP, Lumimaid was designed to be serious, yet uncensored when necessary.\n\nTo enhance it's overall intelligence and chat capability, roughly 40% of the training data was not roleplay. This provides a breadth of knowledge to access, while still keeping roleplay as the primary strength.\n\nUsage of this model is subject to [Meta's Acceptable Use Policy](https://llama.meta.com/llama3/use-policy/).",
