  "description": "Hermes 3 is a generalist language model with many improvements over Hermes 2, including advanced agentic capabilities, much better roleplaying, reasoning, multi-turn conversation, long context coherence, and improvements across the board.\n\nHermes 3 405B is a frontier-level, full-parameter finetune of the Llama-3.1 405B foundation model, focused on aligning LLMs to the user, with powerful steering capabilities and control given to the end user.\n\nThe Hermes 3 series builds and expands on the Hermes 2 set of capabilities, including more powerful and reliable function calling and structured output capabilities, generalist assistant capabilities, and improved code generation skills.\n\nHermes 3 is competitive, if not superior, to Llama-3.1 Instruct models at general capabilities, with varying strengths and weaknesses attributable between the two.",
