    "description": "This safeguard model has 8B parameters and is based on the Llama 3 family. Just like is predecessor, [LlamaGuard 1](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/LlamaGuard-7b), it can do both prompt and response classification.\n\nLlamaGuard 2 acts as a normal LLM would, generating text that indicates whether the given input/output is safe/unsafe. If deemed unsafe, it will also share the content categories violated.\n\nFor best results, please use raw prompt input or the `/completions` endpoint, instead of the chat API.\n\nIt has demonstrated strong performance compared to leading closed-source models in human evaluations.\n\nTo read more about the model release, [click here](https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3/).
