    "description": "QVQ-72B-Preview is an experimental research model developed by the [Qwen](/qwen) team, focusing on enhancing visual reasoning capabilities.\n\n## Performance\n\n|                | **QVQ-72B-Preview** | o1-2024-12-17 | gpt-4o-2024-05-13 | Claude3.5 Sonnet-20241022 | Qwen2VL-72B |\n|----------------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|----------------------------|-------------|\n| MMMU(val)      | 70.3            | 77.3          | 69.1              | 70.4                       | 64.5        |\n| MathVista(mini) | 71.4            | 71.0          | 63.8              | 65.3                       | 70.5        |\n| MathVision(full)   | 35.9            | –             | 30.4              | 35.6                       | 25.9        |\n| OlympiadBench  | 20.4            | –             | 25.9              | –                          | 11.2        |\n\n\n## Limitations\n\n1. **Language Mixing and Code-Switching:** The model might occasionally mix different languages or unexpectedly switch between them, potentially affecting the clarity of its responses.\n2. **Recursive Reasoning Loops:**  There's a risk of the model getting caught in recursive reasoning loops, leading to lengthy responses that may not even arrive at a final answer.\n3. **Safety and Ethical Considerations:** Robust safety measures are needed to ensure reliable and safe performance. Users should exercise caution when deploying this model.\n4. **Performance and Benchmark Limitations:** Despite the improvements in visual reasoning, QVQ doesn’t entirely replace the capabilities of [Qwen2-VL-72B](/qwen/qwen-2-vl-72b-instruct). During multi-step visual reasoning, the model might gradually lose focus on the image content, leading to hallucinations. Moreover, QVQ doesn’t show significant improvement over [Qwen2-VL-72B](/qwen/qwen-2-vl-72b-instruct) in basic recognition tasks like identifying people, animals, or plants.\n\nNote: Currently, the model only supports single-round dialogues and image outputs. It does not support video inputs.",
