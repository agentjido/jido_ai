  "description": "Dolphin 3.0 R1 is the next generation of the Dolphin series of instruct-tuned models.  Designed to be the ultimate general purpose local model, enabling coding, math, agentic, function calling, and general use cases.\n\nThe R1 version has been trained for 3 epochs to reason using 800k reasoning traces from the Dolphin-R1 dataset.\n\nDolphin aims to be a general purpose reasoning instruct model, similar to the models behind ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini.\n\nPart of the [Dolphin 3.0 Collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/cognitivecomputations/dolphin-30-677ab47f73d7ff66743979a3) Curated and trained by [Eric Hartford](https://huggingface.co/ehartford), [Ben Gitter](https://huggingface.co/bigstorm), [BlouseJury](https://huggingface.co/BlouseJury) and [Cognitive Computations](https://huggingface.co/cognitivecomputations)",
