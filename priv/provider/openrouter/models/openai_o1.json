    "description": "The latest and strongest model family from OpenAI, o1 is designed to spend more time thinking before responding. The o1 model series is trained with large-scale reinforcement learning to reason using chain of thought. \n\nThe o1 models are optimized for math, science, programming, and other STEM-related tasks. They consistently exhibit PhD-level accuracy on benchmarks in physics, chemistry, and biology. Learn more in the [launch announcement](https://openai.com/o1).\n",
