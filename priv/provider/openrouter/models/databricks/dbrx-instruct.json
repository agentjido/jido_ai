  "description": "DBRX is a new open source large language model developed by Databricks. At 132B, it outperforms existing open source LLMs like Llama 2 70B and [Mixtral-8x7b](/models/mistralai/mixtral-8x7b) on standard industry benchmarks for language understanding, programming, math, and logic.\n\nIt uses a fine-grained mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture. 36B parameters are active on any input. It was pre-trained on 12T tokens of text and code data. Compared to other open MoE models like Mixtral-8x7B and Grok-1, DBRX is fine-grained, meaning it uses a larger number of smaller experts.\n\nSee the launch announcement and benchmark results [here](https://www.databricks.com/blog/introducing-dbrx-new-state-art-open-llm).\n\n#moe",
