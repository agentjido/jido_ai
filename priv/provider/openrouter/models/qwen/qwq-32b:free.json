  "description": "QwQ is the reasoning model of the Qwen series. Compared with conventional instruction-tuned models, QwQ, which is capable of thinking and reasoning, can achieve significantly enhanced performance in downstream tasks, especially hard problems. QwQ-32B is the medium-sized reasoning model, which is capable of achieving competitive performance against state-of-the-art reasoning models, e.g., DeepSeek-R1, o1-mini.",
