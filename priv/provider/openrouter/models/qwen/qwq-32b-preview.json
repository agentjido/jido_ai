  "description": "QwQ-32B-Preview is an experimental research model focused on AI reasoning capabilities developed by the Qwen Team. As a preview release, it demonstrates promising analytical abilities while having several important limitations:\n\n1. **Language Mixing and Code-Switching**: The model may mix languages or switch between them unexpectedly, affecting response clarity.\n2. **Recursive Reasoning Loops**: The model may enter circular reasoning patterns, leading to lengthy responses without a conclusive answer.\n3. **Safety and Ethical Considerations**: The model requires enhanced safety measures to ensure reliable and secure performance, and users should exercise caution when deploying it.\n4. **Performance and Benchmark Limitations**: The model excels in math and coding but has room for improvement in other areas, such as common sense reasoning and nuanced language understanding.\n\n",
