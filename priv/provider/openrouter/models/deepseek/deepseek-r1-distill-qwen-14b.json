  "description": "DeepSeek R1 Distill Qwen 14B is a distilled large language model based on [Qwen 2.5 14B](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B), using outputs from [DeepSeek R1](/deepseek/deepseek-r1). It outperforms OpenAI's o1-mini across various benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results for dense models.\n\nOther benchmark results include:\n\n- AIME 2024 pass@1: 69.7\n- MATH-500 pass@1: 93.9\n- CodeForces Rating: 1481\n\nThe model leverages fine-tuning from DeepSeek R1's outputs, enabling competitive performance comparable to larger frontier models.",
