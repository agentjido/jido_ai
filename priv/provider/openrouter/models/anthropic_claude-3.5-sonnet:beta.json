    "description": "New Claude 3.5 Sonnet delivers better-than-Opus capabilities, faster-than-Sonnet speeds, at the same Sonnet prices. Sonnet is particularly good at:\n\n- Coding: Scores ~49% on SWE-Bench Verified, higher than the last best score, and without any fancy prompt scaffolding\n- Data science: Augments human data science expertise; navigates unstructured data while using multiple tools for insights\n- Visual processing: excelling at interpreting charts, graphs, and images, accurately transcribing text to derive insights beyond just the text alone\n- Agentic tasks: exceptional tool use, making it great at agentic tasks (i.e. complex, multi-step problem solving tasks that require engaging with other systems)\n\n#multimodal",
