It excels in coding tasks due to extensive training with coding data and is known for its obedience, although it lacks DPO tuning.\n\nThe model is uncensored and is stripped of alignment and bias. It requires an external alignment layer for ethical use. Users are cautioned to use this highly compliant model responsibly, as detailed in a blog post about uncensored models at [erichartford.com/uncensored-models](https://erichartford.com/uncensored-models).\n\n#moe #uncensored",
