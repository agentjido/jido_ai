  "description": "Aion-1.0-Mini 32B parameter model is a distilled version of the DeepSeek-R1 model, designed for strong performance in reasoning domains such as mathematics, coding, and logic. It is a modified variant of a FuseAI model that outperforms R1-Distill-Qwen-32B and R1-Distill-Llama-70B, with benchmark results available on its [Hugging Face page](https://huggingface.co/FuseAI/FuseO1-DeepSeekR1-QwQ-SkyT1-32B-Preview), independently replicated for verification.",
