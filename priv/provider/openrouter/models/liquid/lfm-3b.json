  "description": "Liquid's LFM 3B delivers incredible performance for its size. It positions itself as first place among 3B parameter transformers, hybrids, and RNN models It is also on par with Phi-3.5-mini on multiple benchmarks, while being 18.4% smaller.\n\nLFM-3B is the ideal choice for mobile and other edge text-based applications.\n\nSee the [launch announcement](https://www.liquid.ai/liquid-foundation-models) for benchmarks and more info.",
